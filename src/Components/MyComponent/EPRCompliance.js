            </p>
            <p>
              The Information and Communication revolution has brought enormous
              changes in the way we organize our lives, our economies,
              industries and institutions. These spectacular developments in
              modern times have undoubtedly enhanced the quality of our lives,
              but at the same time, have led to manifold problems including the
              problem of massive amount of hazardous waste and other waste
              generated from electric products. Such waste poses a serious
              threat to human health and environment. The issue of proper
              management of such hazardous E-Waste is therefore critical to the
              protection of livelihood, health and environment.
            </p>
            <p>
              To deal with this ever-rising problem of E-Waste, the government
              of India, through its Ministry of Environment and forest,
              formulated the E-Waste (Management and Handling) Rules in 2016.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>
                FLIPKART INDIA PRIVATE LIMITED STANDS COMMITTED TO IMPLEMENT THE
                E-WASTE UNDER E-WASTE RULES.
              </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>The Basel Convention defines wastes as-</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              “Substances or objects, which are disposed off or are intended to
              be disposed off, or are required to be disposed off by the
              provisions of national laws”.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>E waste has been defined as-</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              “Waste electrical and electronic equipment, whole or in part or
              rejects from their manufacturing and repair process, which are
              intended to be discarded.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Whereas, Electrical and electronic equipment has been defined as:-
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>
                "Equipment which is dependent on electrical currents or
                electro-magnetic fields to fully functional".
              </em>
            </p>
            <p>
              Like hazardous waste, the problem of e-waste has become an
              immediate and long-term concern as its unregulated accumulation
              and recycling can lead to major environmental problems endangering
              human health. This calls for an urgent need for E-Waste Management
              so as to preserve the ecological balance and reduce landfills.
              Recycling end-of-life products is vital if we are to save
              resources and minimize waste. In this regard, we at Flipkart India
              private limited have tied up with Reteck Envirotech Pvt. Ltd, one
              of the world’s largest authorized E-Waste recycler, for
              facilitating our Organization and our customers to enable them to
              dispose E-Waste products after its end-of-life.

              <strong>Why Recycle.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Conserve Resources</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              Creation requires raw resources. But when we recycle, extant
              material is put to use. Recycling saves this extraction of the
              fresh raw resources, and revives the existing ones that are no
              longer of use. This way there is lesser exploitation and more
              conservation of natural resources.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Save Energy</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              Each time we recycle a product, it requires lesser energy than
              producing a new one from the scratch. The considerable difference
              in manufacturing time is a result of skipping the usual process of
              extraction of raw material, its transportation, refining etc.,
              which is way more than having a market ready product that to have
              a raw material ready for production.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Prevent Pollution</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              Production and disposal of products require a great deal of
              extraction, refining, processing and dumping of material, which
              have larger impact on the environment. By recycling, we cut down
              the pollution of air, water and land, thus reducing the greenhouse
              gas emission and avoiding any contribution to global warming.
